        <p>
          Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs
          with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat pump and youre
          still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green
          work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or
          geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into
          the future.

              Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than 
              the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution 
              to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.
            </p>
            <p>
              Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but 
              has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate 
              boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the 
              range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as 
              home heating. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the 
              earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. 
              As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming 
              if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

              If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a 
              wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a 
              wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation 
              potential.

              New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine 
works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.
